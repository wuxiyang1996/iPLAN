Naming policy for our gifs:

iPLAN_Hetero_E_5_90.0_23.95.gif
- iPLAN: Algorithm name (iPLAN, MAPPO, QMIX)
- Hetero: Environment name (Heterogeneous Highway)
- E: Scenario name (E: Mild, H: Chaotic)
- 5: Num of agents succeed (max: 5)
- 90.0: Avg. survival time (max: 90.0)
- 23.95: Avg. speed (Expected: Between 20 and 30)

Result Summary:
We visually compare the performance of iPLAN with QMIX and MAPPO. Each baseline is tested with multiple learning agents shown in green, and each animation gif included shows 5 such learning agents from their respective viewpoints.

Conclusion: All 5 agents succeed using iPLAN as shown in iPLAN animation gifs, whereas on average 2 or more agents crash using QMIX or MAPPO.
